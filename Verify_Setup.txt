This "Setup-Repo" is a test repository that will allow you to learn the basics of Git.

In this repository, create a new file named "first_last.txt". You should then commit and push the file to the remote repository.

After doing so, you can verify that everything worked by going to GitHub online and you should see your file in the "Setup-Repo".
